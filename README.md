# HyperXML-Blog

## Summary

A blog using the resources avalible to GitHub Pages. Since there is no PHP/MySQL, I decided to start with Bootstrap as the front-end framework and XML as a flat file database.

**Advantages:**
* Hosted for free using GitHub
* Blog template using Bootstrap
* Responsive layout

**Disadvantages:**
* Client requires Javascript enabled
* It is not scalable
* No SEO
